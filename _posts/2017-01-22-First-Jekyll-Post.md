Hi folks,  my name is Matt and I am normally a bored developer so I quickly bounce back and forth between technologies.  I have found throughout the years that I learn best by creating tutorials or documentation around new technology and concepts that I am using.  Now to be sure I don't always look at new technology.  For instance I have recently been working on alot of legacy code and that has me researching dependency injection design patterns.  Most design patterns aren't considered new concepts!  Anyway if you continue to visit my blog you will hopefully find interesting development related topics and tutorials.  Thanks for stopping by!!!
