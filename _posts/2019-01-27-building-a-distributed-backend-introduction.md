#### What you will learn and do
In this tutorial series we will be building a set of applications both business and infrastructure related that represent what a production system might end up looking like.  The technologies used here are relevant to what companies are leveraging in application platforms today.  The example business use case is a bit contrived but will serve to demonstrate many of the features offered by spring cloud, cassandra, kafka, and other relevant technologies.  This tutorials will broken down into byte size chunks that end in working examples with articulated learnings.   

##### Technologies Used
* Spring Core
* Spring Cloud
* Eureka
* Hystrix
* Kafka
* Cassandra
* Spring Cloud Gateway
* Swagger
* Junit
* Mockito
* Docker
* Distributed Tracing with Zipkin and Sleuth
* Avro Schema's and Confluent Schema Registry
* Redis
* Spring Security
* Spring Cloud Vault
* OAuth 2

##### Tools
Apache Maven 3.2.2   
Java 8   
Git   
IDE of your choice (Demonstrations will be in eclipse)   

##### What we will build
The business use case will be that of a coffeeshop menu. As the application architecture grows we may add in ordering, delivery, account creation, coffeeshop admin functions, and anything else that comes to mind.  Again this is a contrived usecase that is simply leveraged as a means to show an application architecture.
