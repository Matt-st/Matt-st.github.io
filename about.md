Hello my name is Matt.  I am a Backend developer with experience in the financial services industry.  I have worked at JP Morgan, Capital One, and Acorns.  I have had experience building products for fraud, ledgers, beneficiaries, trusts, transaction processing, and data processing business domains.  On the tecnical side of things, I have worked in the Big data area, API development with both RESTful and Graphql solutions. I have also had professional experience building serverless solutions with java and javascript. My professional experience developing database solutions has primarily involved postgres and dynamodb.

Personally I like to use this blog periodically to explore topics that I am interested in and as a location to document my learnings. I will try to correlate my blog posts with code from my github as examples.

Thanks for reading!
