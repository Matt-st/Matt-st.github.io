Hello my name is Matt.  I am a Backend developer with experience in the financial services industry.  I have worked at JP Morgan, Capital One, and Acorns.  I have had experience building out products for fraud, transactions, ledgers, beneficiaries, trusts, transaction processing, data processing business domains.  On the tecnical side of things I have worked in the Big data area, API development with both RESTful and Graphql solutions. I have professional experience building serverless solutions with java and node application. I also have professional experience developing database solutions with postgres and dynamodb.

Personally I like to use this blog on and off to explore topics that I am interested in and document my learnings. I will try to correlate my blog posts with code from my github as well.
